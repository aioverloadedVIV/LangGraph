0,Dynamic Backtracking,"Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search
tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress
toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which
backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this
difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed
backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful
control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by
earlier approaches.",['M. L. Ginsberg'],9308101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308101v1,files/9308101v1.pdf
1,"A Market-Oriented Programming Environment and its Application to
  Distributed Multicommodity Flow Problems","Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that
under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making
with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach
to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource
allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive
equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for
defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their
corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach
for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of
the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient
distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be
meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.",['M. P. Wellman'],9308102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9308102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9308102v1,files/9308102v1.pdf
2,An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT,"We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure
for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the
number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a
more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in
detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau
search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,
there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of
satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make
detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the
average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score
and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by
showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.
This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to
improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.","['I. P. Gent', 'T. Walsh']",9309101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9309101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9309101v1,files/9309101v1.pdf
3,The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut,"As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning
procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut
predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be
learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning
systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of
a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to
generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and
then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of
learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to
be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate
the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually
caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,
the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that
learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be
restricted to purely declarative logic languages.","['F. Bergadano', 'D. Gunetti', 'U. Trinchero']",9311101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9311101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9311101v1,files/9311101v1.pdf
4,Software Agents: Completing Patterns and Constructing User Interfaces,"To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information,
this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers
with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is
going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user
interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice
software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and
semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned
information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface.
Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this
on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information
on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking
softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the
interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and
constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of
the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting
archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from
mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the
dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.","['J. C. Schlimmer', 'L. A. Hermens']",9311102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9311102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9311102v1,files/9311102v1.pdf
5,Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems,"Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for
designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages
(or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS
whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new
features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized
in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological
language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number
restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion
statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular
case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction
services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a
sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge
bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a
byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in
ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is
adopted.","['M. Buchheit', 'F. M. Donini', 'A. Schaerf']",9312101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9312101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9312101v1,files/9312101v1.pdf
6,Teleo-Reactive Programs for Agent Control,"A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous
agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R)
programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the
continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action
is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter
binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other
circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it
is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the
contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R
programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is
compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe
some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and
actual mobile robots.",['N. Nilsson'],9401101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9401101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9401101v1,files/9401101v1.pdf
7,"Learning the Past Tense of English Verbs: The Symbolic Pattern
  Associator vs. Connectionist Models","Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of
language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become
a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several
artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for
better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a
general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree
learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the
generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different
representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen
verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why
this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for
decision-tree learning algorithms.",['C. X. Ling'],9402101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9402101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402101v1,files/9402101v1.pdf
8,"Substructure Discovery Using Minimum Description Length and Background
  Knowledge","The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an
essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a
new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum
description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that
compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By
replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of
SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the
data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies
similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an
approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational
constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other
background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more
appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate
SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data
and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of
Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery
system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in
graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding
value.","['D. J. Cook', 'L. B. Holder']",9402102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9402102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402102v1,files/9402102v1.pdf
9,Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories,"The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a
deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose
inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision
problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called
PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically
track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the
precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or
undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to
efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to
converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown
experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.","['M. Koppel', 'R. Feldman', 'A. M. Segre']",9402103v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9402103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9402103v1,files/9402103v1.pdf
10,"Exploring the Decision Forest: An Empirical Investigation of Occam's
  Razor in Decision Tree Induction","We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent
with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an
understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the
factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we
investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent
with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The
experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results
of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate
that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees
are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger
trees.","['P. M. Murphy', 'M. J. Pazzani']",9403101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9403101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9403101v1,files/9403101v1.pdf
11,"A Semantics and Complete Algorithm for Subsumption in the CLASSIC
  Description Logic","This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in
CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is
being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with
individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an
algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic
semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for
descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and
which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the
polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs,
which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in
CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.","['A. Borgida', 'P. F. Patel-Schneider']",9406101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9406101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9406101v1,files/9406101v1.pdf
12,Applying GSAT to Non-Clausal Formulas,"In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to
non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which
gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false
under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without
constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to
most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.",['R. Sebastiani'],9406102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9406102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9406102v1,files/9406102v1.pdf
13,Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy,"Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we
consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a
degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning
about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all
possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB,
and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of
belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show
that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary
predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N
grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can
use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result
is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence,
but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the
limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates
seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the
connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These
observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of
maximum-entropy methods.","['A. J. Grove', 'J. Y. Halpern', 'D. Koller']",9408101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408101v1,files/9408101v1.pdf
14,"Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from
  Japanese Text","Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of
interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually
extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant
pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse
processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the
first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing
any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can
achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to
understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information.
Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly
because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other
pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a
structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper
reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information
using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high
level of system performance which approaches human performance.","['T. Kitani', 'Y. Eriguchi', 'M. Hara']",9408102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408102v1,files/9408102v1.pdf
15,A System for Induction of Oblique Decision Trees,"This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees.
This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of
randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at
each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned
especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can
be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present
extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze
OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate
than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of
randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.","['S. K. Murthy', 'S. Kasif', 'S. Salzberg']",9408103v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9408103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9408103v1,files/9408103v1.pdf
16,On Planning while Learning,"This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent
is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially
known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design
processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning
systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However,
coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is
apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design
processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection)
part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.","['S. Safra', 'M. Tennenholtz']",9409101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9409101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9409101v1,files/9409101v1.pdf
17,Wrap-Up: a Trainable Discourse Module for Information Extraction,"The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest
in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text,
producing a structured representation of selected information from the text.
This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire
knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE
discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies
logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous
corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as
part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction.
Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers
are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically.
Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring
manual customization for each domain.","['S. Soderland', 'Lehnert. W']",9412101v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9412101v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412101v1,files/9412101v1.pdf
18,Operations for Learning with Graphical Models,"This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning
from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models
include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and
undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are
extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of
plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are
provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of
probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas
for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the
expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some
popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This
includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks,
and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper
concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how
some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original
contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that
graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex
learning algorithms.",['W. L. Buntine'],9412102v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9412102v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412102v1,files/9412102v1.pdf
19,Total-Order and Partial-Order Planning: A Comparative Analysis,"For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely
taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest
in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we
present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order
planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We
show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread
intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For
instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon
the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the
underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.","['S. Minton', 'J. Bresina', 'M. Drummond']",9412103v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9412103v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9412103v1,files/9412103v1.pdf
