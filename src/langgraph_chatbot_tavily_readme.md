# LangGraph Chatbot with Tavily Search Tool

A conversational AI chatbot built with **LangGraph** and **OpenAI API** that can search the web in real-time using **Tavily Search API** as a tool.

## Features

- **Agentic Workflow**: Uses LangGraph's state management for structured conversation flow
- **Web Search Integration**: Accesses real-time information via Tavily Search API
- **Tool Calling**: LLM autonomously decides when to search the web
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions

## Architecture

```
User Query â†’ Chatbot Node â†’ Conditional Edge
                 â†“                    â†“
            (No tool needed)    (Search needed)
                 â†“                    â†“
            Final Response      Tool Node (Tavily)
                                      â†“
                                Chatbot Node
                                      â†“
                                Final Response
```

## Key Components

- **State Management**: `TypedDict` with message history tracking
- **LLM Node**: `chatbot()` - Processes user queries and generates responses
- **Tool Node**: Executes Tavily search when needed
- **Conditional Edges**: Routes to tools or ends workflow based on LLM decision

## How It Works

1. User sends a query
2. LLM analyzes if web search is needed
3. If yes â†’ Calls Tavily API â†’ Returns search results â†’ LLM synthesizes answer
4. If no â†’ LLM responds directly from knowledge
5. Maintains conversation state throughout

## Tech Stack

- **LangGraph**: Workflow orchestration
- **LangChain**: LLM integration framework
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Language model
- **Tavily Search API**: Real-time web search
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

## Notes

- The chatbot automatically determines when to use web search
- Tavily returns top 3 results per query (configurable)
- Type `quit`, `exit`, `bye`, or `q` to end the conversation
