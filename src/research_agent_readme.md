# Research Agent: AI-Powered Research Assistant

### “Accelerating Literature Discovery and Knowledge Synthesis with Generative AI”

---

## Problem:

Modern researchers especially **PhD students, data scientists, and R&D engineers** spend **4 to 6 hours per topic** scanning academic papers, filtering irrelevant results, and manually summarizing insights.

Even with platforms like **ArXiv**, **Google Scholar**, and **Semantic Scholar**, the workflow is fragmented:

- Papers are hard to compare across topics
- Abstracts often miss the methodology details researchers care about
- Most search tools retrieve documents but don’t *synthesize* knowledge

This creates **information overload** and **context fragmentation**, slowing down innovation.

---

## Solution:

**Research Agent** is an **autonomous AI research assistant**. In short, what takes a PhD student 4 hours this agent can do in **under 5 minutes**. It’s a **“literature co-pilot”** designed to reduce cognitive load, accelerate research, and surface meaningful insights from dense academic content.
